**Elementary ‐The Office ‐ I need an assistant! (C0004)** 

**A:** ...like I told you before, we just don’t have the resources to hire you an assistant. 

**B:** I understand that, but the fact is we’re understaffed. 

**A:** The timing is just not right. The economy is bad, 

and it’s too risky to take on new staff. 

**B:** Yeah, I guess you’re right.... here’s an idea, what 

if we hire an intern? She would take some of the weight off my shoulders. 

**A:** She? 

**B:** Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down. 

**A:** That sounds reasonable... let me see what I can do. 

**A:** Tony, I’d like to introduce you to your new assistant. 

**B:** OK, great! Let’s meet her! 

**C:** Hi, I’m Adam. 

**B:** Oh... hi... I’m Tony...

**A:** Oh no!Look at that line! It must be a mile long! 

There’s no way I’m waiting for another two hours. 

**B:** Honey... don’t... 

**C:** Hey man, the end of the line is over there. 

**A:** Yeah... 

**C:** No seriously, I was here first, and you can’t cut in 

line like this. 

**A:** Says who? 

**C:** I do! 

**A:** So sue me! 

**C:** Alright...that’s it....

**A:** But we’ve only been on the road for ten minutes. 

**B:** I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before 

we left.

**B:** I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns 

out that you have a lot of infected files! 

**A:** But Im quite careful when Im browsing the 

internet, I have no idea how I could have picked 

up a virus. 

**B:** Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn’t up to date, that’s probably what was causing your problems. 

**A:** Ok. Anything else? 

**B:** Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! 

**A:** Um yeah& Sorry about that.

you live around here? 

**B:** Actually, my office is right around the corner. 

**A:** It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign 

investment. 

**B:** Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, I’m in a bit of a hurry, but here’s my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. 

**A:** Sure, you still have my contact details, right ? 

**B:** You know what, this is really embarrassing, but 

your name has just slipped my mind. Can you 

remind me?

it; it happens to me all the time. I’m terrible with 

names too.

keep it down?

watch a movie here! 

**Elementary ‐ The Office ‐ Driving Sales (C0010)** 

**A:** All right, people. We’re holding this meeting today because we’ve got to do something about our sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete solutions. How do you intend to drive sales... Roger? 

**B:** Well, in fact, we’re the most expensive in the market, so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors? 

**A:** Lower our prices? Not very creative. It’ll never fly with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? 

**C:** Um, perhaps, um, a sales promotion. Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that! 

**A:** What? That’s the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO will be here any minute. 

**D:** Do we have any ideas yet? 

**C:** Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a twofor- 

one offer to get more competitive. 

**D:** A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the 

sound of that. It sounds like something we should 

consider. 

**A:** Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, 

that’s a brilliant idea! I’m glad we thought of that. 

Very creative.
